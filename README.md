# Release Flow Extension

The Release Flow Extension is a custom extension for Azure Pipelines that supports [Release
Flow](https://github.com/release-flow/release-flow).

The extension's [readme file](./extension/README.md) provides a user manual.

## Installation

You can install the extension from the [Visual Studio Marketplace](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=release-flow-dev.release-flow-tools).

## Build and Deployment

Unsurprisingly, this repo uses Release Flow conventions :)

The extension is built and deployed via an [Azure DevOps
pipeline](https://dev.azure.com/richtebb/release-flow/_build?definitionId=7).
